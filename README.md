# Weapon Detection using YOLOv5
This project implements a two-stage real-time weapon detection system using YOLOv5 models. It utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify weapons in video streams or camera feeds.

üîç Overview
- The code leverages PyTorch and OpenCV to:

- Load YOLOv5 models (likely two versions: a lightweight and a larger one)

- Process video input (live or file-based)

- Detect and possibly classify weapons in real-time

Note: The notebook does not include a markdown introduction, so this summary is inferred from the code content.
